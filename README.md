# Dominion GUI Card Creator
This is a tool to create custom cards for the game Dominion, created by Donald X. Vaccarino, published by Rio Grande Games.

This is partially intended to work aside Shard Of Honor's card creator, but is not really a replacement. Maybe someday, but not now.

## Card designs
**ALL** card designs are property of Donald X. Vaccarino and Rio Grande Games, not me.

All designs of cards are taken from shardofhonor's similar card creator, found at https://shardofhonor.github.io/dominion-card-generator/.

# Building
## Linux
### Requirements:
* `g++`
* CMake
* git CLI
* Internet (I mean, really)

After downloading and extracting, run `setup.sh`. This will download the appropriate libraries and compile everything.

## Windows
Nothing to compile now (sadly), but hopefully in the future there will be prebuilt exe's or something. :shrug:

# Other notes
Unless specified with --high-res, all images (excluding the coin, debt, and VP token) are rendered at half resolution for better load times and performance.
## Curl
This program uses Curl for downloading images. It's website can be found [here](https://curl.se/), and it's license can be found [here](https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html), or by running the program with `--curl-license`.
